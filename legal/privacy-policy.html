                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>There are many different ways you can use our services - to share information, to communicate with other
                    people, or to create new content.</p>
                <p>When you share information with us, for example by creating an account with us, we can make those
                    services even better - to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and
                    easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we're using information and the ways in
                    which you can protect your privacy.</p>
                <p>Where our processing of your information is covered by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679
                    ("<strong>GDPR</strong>").</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Our Privacy Policy explains:</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
                    <li>How we use that information.</li>
                    <li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We've tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you're not familiar with terms like cookies, IP
                    addresses and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to us; whether you
                    are new to Oxmaint Inc. or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices -
                    and if you have any questions, contact us.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Transparency and choice</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so
                    that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used and control who you share information with. By
                    providing personal information to us, you consent to us collecting, holding, using and disclosing your
                    personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You do not have to provide personal
                    information to us, however, if you do not, it may affect your use of this Site or the products and/or
                    services offered on or through it.</p>
                <p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to
                    indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it's important to remember that many of our services
                    may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, you may not be able to login to Oxmaint Inc. or utilize other services.

                <h2>Information we collect</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff
                    like which language you speak, to more complex things like what content of ours matters most to you.</p>
                <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information you give us. We collect information about you and your company as you register for an
                        account with us, create or modify your profile, use, access, or interact with our services or our
                        websites (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share content)
                        Such content includes any personal information or other sensitive information that you choose to
                        include. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an account with us. When you
                        do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit
                        card. We may present your name, email address or image to other users in your organization, or
                        otherwise associated with your account in order to assist in sharing or recommendations.</li>
                    <li>Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that
                        you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our services or you view and
                        interact with our content. This information includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Device information</strong> - We may collect device-specific information (such as
                                your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network
                                information including phone number). We may associate your device identifiers or phone
                                number with your account.</li>
                            <li><strong>Log information</strong> - When you use our services or view content provided by us,
                                we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries;</li>
                                    <li>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding
                                        numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and
                                        types of calls;</li>
                                    <li>Internet Protocol address;</li>
                                    <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings,
                                        browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL;
                                        and</li>
                                    <li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Location information</strong> - When you use a location-enabled Oxmaint Inc.
                                service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals
                                sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as
                                sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi
                                access points and cell towers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unique application numbers - </strong>Certain services include a unique application
                                number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating
                                system type and application version number) may be sent to us when you install or uninstall
                                that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic
                                updates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Local storage</strong> - We may collect and store information (including personal
                                information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including
                                HTML 5) and application data caches.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers </strong>- We use various technologies to collect
                                and store information when you visit our services, and this may include sending one or more
                                cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous
                                identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising
                                services or Oxmaint Inc. features that may appear on other sites.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h2>How we use information we collect</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We may use the information we collect, including your personal information and transaction information,
                    from all of our services in any one or more of the locations that Oxmaint Inc. has operations or
                    otherwise conducts business for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>for internal and service-related purposes, such as to provide, maintain, protect, improve, and
                        personalize our services, to develop new ones and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Oxmaint Inc. and our users;</li>
                    <li>to communicate with you in order to provide you with information we think may be useful or relevant
                        to you;</li>
                    <li>to promote our services and related services;</li>

                    <li>to facilitate the sharing of anonymized information with third parties, including transaction data.
                        An example of anonymized information would be the number of times a template is used or location
                        data , which may be used by those third parties to inform judgments about the organization using
                        the software, but not about any individuals whose data is processed using the software;</li>
                    <li>to enforce the Privacy Policy and our terms and conditions for use of our services and websites;
                    </li>
                    <li>to monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our services and for
                        marketing or advertising purposes or to offer you tailored content;</li>
                    <li>to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to or use of our services,
                        and other illegal or unusual activities;</li>

                        represented consistently across all our services. If other users
                        already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly
                        visible Oxmaint Inc. profile information, such as your name and photo;</li>
                    <li>when you contact us, to keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be
                        facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know
                        about upcoming changes or improvements;</li>
                    <li>from cookies and other technologies, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our
                        services;</li>

                </ul>
                <p>To use the information we collect, we may require our systems to access, screen capture, store, video
                    and/or scan your information. Where appropriate or required by data protection laws, we will ask for

                    Policy.</p>

                <p>We may need to retain certain personal information after we cease providing you with products or services
                    to enforce our terms, for fraud prevention, to identify, issue or resolve legal claims and/or for proper
                    record keeping.</p>

                <h3>Information you share</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information
                    publicly, it may be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on
                    sharing and removing your content.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    body or law enforcement agency, and if permitted under GDPR and other laws, we may disclose certain
                    information to such bodies or agencies. </p>
                <p><strong>Merger or acquisition</strong></p>
                <p>If we merge with or are acquired by another business, we may share your personal information with the new

                <p>We have put in place robust measures regarding the security of the information we collect and store about
                    you (including through the use of network and database security measures) and will use our reasonable
                    endeavors to protect your personal data from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
                    disclosure or destruction. In particular:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We encrypt many of our services using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS).
                    </li>
                    <li>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security
                        measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
                    <li>We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know
                        that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual
                        confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these
                        obligations.</li>
                    <li>We have multiple authentication and access control measures to ensure data is only accessed by
                        authorised personnel</li>
                    <li>We enforce strong encryption of all data at rest through the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard
                        (AES-256)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data
                    necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. </p>
                <p>The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best
                    to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our servers
                    via third party networks; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information,
                    we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>The Legal Basis for Processing your Information </h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Under GDPR, the main grounds that we rely upon in order to process personal data collected via our
                    websites and services are the following:</p>
                <p>(a) <strong>Necessary for entering into, or performing, a contract</strong> – in order to perform
                    obligations that we undertake in providing a service to you, or in order to take steps at your request
                    to enter into a contract with us, it will be necessary for us to process your personal data;</p>
                <p>(b) <strong>Necessary for compliance with a legal obligation</strong> – we are subject to certain legal
                    requirements which may require us to process your personal data. We may also be obliged by law to
                    disclose your personal data to a regulatory body or law enforcement agency;</p>
                <p>(c) <strong>Necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests</strong> - either we, or a third party,
                    will need to process your personal data for the purposes of our (or a third party's) legitimate
                    interests, provided we have established that those interests are not overridden by your rights and
                    freedoms, including your right to have your personal data protected. Our legitimate interests include
                    responding to requests and inquiries from you or a third party, optimizing our website, applications and
                    customer experience, informing you about our products and services and ensuring that our operations are
                    conducted in an appropriate and efficient manner;</p>
                <p>(d) <strong>Consent</strong> – in some circumstances, we may ask for your consent to process your
                    personal data in a particular way. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Third Party Service Providers</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, we will share your personal information with trusted third parties where we have
                    retained them to provide services that you or our clients have requested, and to perform maintenance or
                    respond to technical incidents affecting our services.</p>
                <p>Where we disclose personal information to third parties, we require minimum standards of confidentiality
                    and data protection from such third parties. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Processing Outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA")</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>To the extent that any personal information is provided to third parties outside the EEA, or who will
                    access the information from outside the EEA, we will ensure that approved safeguards are in place to
                    ensure that we comply with GDPR, such as the standard contractual clauses approved by the European
                    Commission or the EU/US Privacy Shield.</p>
                <p>Oxmaint Inc. processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may
                    process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live, including
                    outside the EEA. The primary location of user data and data uploaded to OXmaint and Spotlight is a
                    data centre in the U.S. operated by our third-party cloud hosting provider, Amazon Web Services ("AWS").
                    AWS is a participant in the EU/US Privacy Shield, under which transfers of personal data to the U.S. are
                    authorised. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Retention of Personal Data </h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We will retain your personal information for the time necessary to provide the services we perform for
                    you, or to achieve other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you can always request that we
                    stop processing or delete your personal information (see the section below regarding your rights).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Your rights in respect of information we hold about you </h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You have certain rights in relation to personal information we hold about you. Details of these rights
                    and how to exercise them are set out below. We will require evidence of your identity before we are able
                    to act on your request.</p>
                <p><strong>Right of Access</strong></p>
                <p>You have the right at any time to ask us for a copy of the personal information about you that we hold.
                    Where we have good reason, and if the GDPR permits, we can refuse your request for a copy of your
                    personal information, or certain elements of the request. If we refuse your request or any element of
                    it, we will provide you with our reasons for doing so.</p>
                <p><strong>Right of Correction or Completion</strong></p>
                <p>If personal information we hold about you is not accurate, out of date or incomplete, you have a right to
                    have the data rectified, updated or completed. You can let us know by contacting us at <a
                        href="mailto:contact@oxmaint.com">contact@oxmaint.com</a></p>
                <p><strong>Right of Erasure</strong></p>
                <p>In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that personal information we hold about you is
                    erased e.g. if the information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or
                    processed or our processing of the information is based on your consent and there are no other legal
                    grounds on which we may process the information.</p>
                <p><strong> </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Right to object to or restrict processing</strong></p>
                <p>In certain circumstances, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal information by
                    contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@oxmaint.com">contact@oxmaint.com</a>. For
                    example, if we are processing your information on the basis of our legitimate interests and there are no
                    compelling legitimate grounds for our processing which override your rights and interests. You also have
                    the right to object to use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>
                <p>You may also have the right to restrict our use of your personal information, such as in circumstances
                    where you have challenged the accuracy of the information and during the period where we are verifying
                    its accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Right of Data Portability</strong></p>
                <p>In certain instances, you have a right to receive any personal information that we hold about you in a
                    structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You can ask us to transmit that information to
                    you or directly to a third party organization.</p>
                <p>The above right exists only in respect of personal information that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you have provided to us previously; and</li>
                    <li>is processed by us using automated means.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While we are happy for such requests to be made, we are not able to guarantee technical compatibility
                    with a third party organization's systems. We are also unable to comply with requests that relate to
                    personal information of others without their consent. </p>
                <p>You can exercise any of the above rights by contacting us using any of the methods in the Contact section
                    above.</p>
                <p>Most of the above rights are subject to limitations and exceptions. We will provide reasons if we are
                    unable to comply with any request for the exercise of your rights.</p>
                <p>To the extent that we are processing your personal information based on your consent, you have the right
                    to withdraw your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting us using the details in the Contact
                    section above.</p>
